#### NOTE: This is an unofficial fork. All issues with this version should be reported here and NOT to [PEKKA-Space WarpThrust](https://github.com/PEKKA-Space/WarpThrust)

# Features
Warp Thrust is a mod that allows you to apply thrust during on-rails time warp.

Different modes can be selected to fine-tune how WarpThrust works:
* Thrust modes allow you to apply thrust in the direction the engines are pointed or apply thrust on the selected SAS vector regardless of engine direction 
* Rotation modes allow you to determine whether your vessel automatically rotates during warp thrust
* Engine modes allow you to use an engine in warp thrust only when it is activated or use it whenever warp thrust is engaged

## Dependencies
